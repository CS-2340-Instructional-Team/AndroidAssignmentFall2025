# AndroidAssignmentFall2025
In this assignment, you will be completing the implementation of a simple Number Guessing Game App by filling in 7 different TODOs representing missing parts of a fully functional app.

The app will have one Activity (GameActivity) that allows the user to:
Input a guess (between 1 and 100)
Submit the guess and see feedback (too high, too low, or correct)
Reset the game to play again

The project folder contains 7 TODOs in 4 different files:
`GameActivity.java` contains TODO 1, 3, 4, 6
`GameManagerSingleton.java` contains TODO 2
`activity_game.xml` contains TODO 5
`ExampleUnitTest.java` contains TODO 7
Note: Some of the TODOs depend on earlier ones. We recommend doing them in sequential order.


Refer to the Android tutorial videos posted on Canvas for implementation tips.
